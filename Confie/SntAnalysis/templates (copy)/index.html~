						Users, mainly the technocrats, entrepreneur, investors, professors, students etc do not have a common platform to discuss and collect each other’s opinions regarding the conferences. The idea is to provide user the ratings of the conferences so that they could understand and plan their schedule accordingly. Users attend the events like IBM Information on demand, IBM Digital Experiences, Oracle World etc and provide their feedback on Twitter. The idea is to use the real time streaming data from the twitter; commonly known as “tweets”. The first Step would be to connect to twitter and search for tweets that contain a set of keywords provided by our user. Second step would be to evaluate the polarity of the tweets based on the words. The classes could be very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative. We would need to score all the tweets and come up with some algorithm in order to find an aggregated value. We would use Twitter API’s to connect on twitter and Python for data mining the tweets. The reason for choosing Python is because of its libraries like NLTK which are very good not only for performing natural language analysis but also for the large community that uses it.
